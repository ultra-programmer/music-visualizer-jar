# music-visualizer-jar
A more compact and easy to use way to run my [music visualizer](https://github.com/ultra-programmer/music-visualizer). To run, just make sure you have the Java Development Kit installed, per instructions below:
<br>Download the [Java Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html).

Once the program is installed, download this repository's source code and extract the files. Then, making sure the `resources` and `icons` folders are in the same directory as `MusicVisualizer.jar`, you should be able to double-click the `.jar` file to run it. To change the songs played, simply upload `.mp3` files into the `resources` folder, and then add the name of the file without the `.mp3` file extension to `resources/songPaths.txt` to add it to the playlist of songs.
